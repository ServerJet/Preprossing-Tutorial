This tutorial is made to help fresh developers to understand what preprocessing is. For this tutorial I have selected a dataset that has kept track of the Air quality in a certian region 
over a long period of time. There are many parameters associated to this dataset observing many pollutants in the enviornment. Since the data is collected by sensors hourly for decades,
there are some instances where the data is either corrupted or missing due to real world problems. For this, the author of this dataset has replaced the missing values with -200 value.
this and more imperfections in the data make it hard or impossible for the developer to train the model with the imperfect data. So, we have to filter the data before we feed it to the
algorithm in order to have a smooth, error-free and accurate training.
